            <p>NANA-KI is founded by Mother Daughter Duo Rita and Vidhi Pandya.</p>

            <h3>How the Brand Name Came into Existence?</h3>
            <p>
                Vidhi shares â€“ In March 2024, NANA-KI turned 1. I canâ€™t believe itâ€™s been a year, a year to something we had not really dreamt of, except for only one man up there, who lived dreaming this dream for his daughter and left earth on that note - my motherâ€™s father & my Nanaji, and hence the brand name NANA-KI.
            </p>
            <p>
                NANA-KI is completely on & because of my motherâ€™s talent, her creation, and her vision! This journey has been so new, refreshing, enlightening in terms of understanding our Indian cultures and the way it speaks through different fabrics & colours.
            </p>

            <h3>How the Idea to Start NANA-KI Was Thought Off?</h3>
            <p>
                Rita shares â€“ I have been personally designing my outfits over the years. Though I donâ€™t have formal education in fashion designing, I believe most women have a very good taste in fashion. I felt there was a lack of ethnic casual outfits in the market which women can also use for formal use. Hence, we decided to start with block printed shirts as I have always been fascinated by the artisanal made block printed fabrics along with ethnic printed fabrics.
            </p>

            <p>A big thank you to our customers who believed in us & gave NANA-KI a chance! Thank you!</p>

            <p>
                Itâ€™s been quite a blissful journey of launching different prints, seeing them getting sold out, restocking, and never-ending goof ups. The process of learning & unlearning every single day to be the best at what we create and deliver.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your blessings and support give us so much strength & confidence that we will be coming up with new styles regularly. We really hope you guys love it, so stay tuned ðŸ˜Š
